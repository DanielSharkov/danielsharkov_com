This strangly named project „Dgraph-GraphQL-Go-Svelte“ was a test. It's actually a frontend for the backend [dgraph-graphql-go](https://github.com/romshark/dgraph_graphql_go), which is also just a test project developed by [Roman Scharkov](https://github.com/romshark). It was more like a experience to me how to make a frontend communicating with a backend, but not only an expertise for the frontend developing aswell I gathered alot of useful expertise for backend developing, which actually helped me to understand better what a backend is and what is does, so I could apply all the used methodologies and some code written by [Roman Scharkov](https://github.com/romshark) to my current projects.

# Priorities
Before I could even finilize this project I was interupted by other things in life which were more pioritiezed. So far I wasn't able to spare more time for this project. But however, it doesn't make any sense to proceed, because it was only a test of my expertise.

# Conclusion
Now is nothing more important than the experience I've made which I may apply to my projects in the future.
