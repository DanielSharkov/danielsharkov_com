## Shortly summarized:
Back then when I made my apprenticeship and visited a school I had an exam in the subject SAE (in english SAD: Software-Application-Development) where I had to implement a basic chess game without any kind of visualization, only console output. So I was inspired by this idea and started programming such a project with a visualization in my freetime on my vacation at Lake Maggiore.
