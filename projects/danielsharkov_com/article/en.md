## Shortly summarized:
Basicly it's about the website you're currently visiting (if you maybe didn't notice ðŸ˜ƒ). I'll tell you soon more about it.

### Little tips - Cool features:
- i18n Translation with automatic detection of the locale (EN or DE)
- Dark/Light Theming: Automatic dark & light theme detection durch by supported operating systems (event the most project covers are switching!)
- A11y: Automatic detection of motion reduction
- A11y: Automatic detection for more contrast (currently only the Safari browser supports it)
