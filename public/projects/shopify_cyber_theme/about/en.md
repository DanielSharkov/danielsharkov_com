## Shortly summarized:
I allways wanted my own shop design and so I began creating one in my freetime. Firstly I created an efficient frontend-system which doesn't require any third-party librabries and therefor is much faster than the most other frontend-systems. The look is inspired by a cyberpunk style. Not done yet - construction site.
