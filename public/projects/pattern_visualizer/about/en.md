# Description coming soon...

## Shortly summarized:
As the name says: A pattern visualizer - which I required for the project [Timetabler](https://danielsharkov.github.io/beta_danielsharkov_com/?project=timetabler). It renders a pattern of days within the defined amount of total days (1 year / 365 days) regarding the school and legal holidays.
