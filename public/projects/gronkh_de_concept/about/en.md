## *â€žWhat's this â€žGronkhâ€œ in your title and everybody is talking about?â€œ*
Gronkh aka Erik *(Bourgeois name: Erik Range)* is probably the dearest person on earth, how puts alot of effort with a big heart and passion in his hobby as a â€žLet's playerâ€œ and streamer at Twitch.tv ([gronkh.tv](http://gronkh.tv)) *(state of May 2021)*. I follow him already since 2011 where I was very young and he was uploading his famous and legendary let's play about Minecraft ([Let's Play Minecraft #001 [Deutsch] [HD] - Alles auf Anfang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM52HxaLK-Y&t=366s)), which I watched besides the other let's plays he uploaded too. Funny, intelligent, charm and much more are characteristics that describes him best. I recommend you to have a look!

## Shortly summarized:
A web-app as an archive for a better and clearer overview of his let's plays, streams, podcasts, upcoming events, FAQ and many many more things. A central and universal platform for him and his audience aka Chat (insider).
